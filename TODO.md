# TODO List

## Completed Tasks ✅

### Ride Flow Refactoring - COMPLETED ✅
- [x] Extract NavigationScreen, OtpScreen, and RideInProgressScreen from HomeScreen.tsx into separate files in src/screens/ride/.
- [x] Move RideRequestScreen from components to screens/ride/ if it is a full-screen flow, and update imports accordingly.
- [x] Update AppNavigator/MainNavigator to include the new ride flow screens (NavigationScreen, OtpScreen, RideInProgressScreen, RideRequestScreen if moved).
- [x] Refactor HomeScreen to use navigation for ride flow instead of showing overlays, and pass ride/request data via navigation params.

### Summary of Changes Made:
1. **Created new screen files:**
   - `src/screens/ride/NavigationScreen.tsx` - Handles navigation to pickup with map and route display
   - `src/screens/ride/OtpScreen.tsx` - Handles OTP input for ride start
   - `src/screens/ride/RideInProgressScreen.tsx` - Handles ride in progress with navigation to dropoff

2. **Updated navigation:**
   - Added new screens to `AppNavigator.tsx` MainNavigator stack
   - Updated HomeScreen to use `navigation.navigate()` instead of showing overlays
   - Ride flow now follows: HomeScreen → NavigationScreen → OtpScreen → RideInProgressScreen → EndRideScreen → HomeScreen

3. **Cleaned up HomeScreen:**
   - Removed inline component definitions (NavigationScreen, OtpScreen, RideInProgressScreen)
   - Removed state variables for ride flow management (navigationRide, showOtp, rideInProgress)
   - Removed related handler functions that are now handled by separate screens
   - Simplified ride request handling to navigate to appropriate screens

4. **Maintained functionality:**
   - All ride flow functionality preserved
   - Socket communication maintained
   - Ride history tracking maintained
   - Map and location services maintained

## Pending Tasks

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Consider moving RideRequestScreen from components to screens/ride/ if it's a full-screen modal
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript interfaces for all ride-related data structures
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and loading states for the new screens
- [ ] Add unit tests for the new screen components
- [ ] Consider adding animations for screen transitions

### Bug Fixes
- [ ] Fix any remaining TypeScript errors in the new screen files
- [ ] Test the complete ride flow to ensure all navigation works correctly
- [ ] Verify that socket events are properly handled across the new screen structure
